"""
Data loading module for NBA season and game data.

This module handles loading and processing NBA game data from JSON files.
It provides classes for representing seasons, games, and game collections,
along with utility functions for filtering and analyzing game data.

The module defines granular time intervals for game analysis, supporting
minute-by-minute analysis as well as sub-minute intervals (down to 5-second
increments) in the final minute of the game.
